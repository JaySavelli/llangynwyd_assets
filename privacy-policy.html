<h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

<p>Effective Date: January 2026</p>

<p>This Privacy Policy describes how Flockly ("we", "our", or "us") collects, uses, and protects information when you use the Flockly mobile application.</p>

<h2>Overview</h2>

<p>Flockly is a public directory application that helps users discover local clubs and community groups. The app does not require user accounts and does not directly collect personal data from users, except as described below.</p>

<h2>Information We Collect</h2>

<h3>1. Location Data (Optional)</h3>
<p>If you choose to grant location permission, the app uses your device location to calculate distances to nearby clubs. Your precise location is not stored on our servers and is used only within the app for distance calculations.</p>
<p>You may deny or revoke location access at any time through your device settings.</p>

<h3>2. Crash and Diagnostic Data</h3>
<p>We use Firebase Crashlytics, a service provided by Google, to collect anonymous crash reports and technical diagnostics. This helps us identify and fix app stability issues. This data does not include personally identifiable information.</p>

<h3>3. Analytics Data</h3>
<p>We may use Firebase Analytics to understand how users interact with the app. This may include anonymous usage information such as screen views and general device information. This data is aggregated and does not personally identify you.</p>

<h3>4. Information Submitted via Forms</h3>
<p>The app may include links or embedded web views to Google Forms for suggesting new clubs or updates. If you choose to submit information through these forms, you may optionally provide your email address so that we can contact you regarding your submission. This information is processed through Google Forms and is not stored directly within the app.</p>

<h2>Local Storage</h2>

<p>The app may store certain data locally on your device, such as favourite clubs. This data remains on your device and is not transmitted to our servers.</p>

<h2>Public Club Information</h2>

<p>The club information displayed in the app is publicly sourced. We do not guarantee the accuracy of this information and recommend contacting clubs directly to confirm details.</p>

<h2>Data Sharing</h2>

<p>We do not sell, rent, or trade personal information. We only use trusted third-party services (such as Google Firebase) to operate and improve the app.</p>

<h2>Children's Privacy</h2>

<p>The app is intended for general audiences. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children.</p>

<h2>Data Security</h2>

<p>We take reasonable measures to protect data processed through the app. However, no method of transmission over the internet is completely secure.</p>

<h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>

<p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Updates will be reflected on this page with a revised effective date.</p>
